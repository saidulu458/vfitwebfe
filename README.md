web_deployment_final_deskspace2.yml===>This script will work to take a backup of existing **.ear** and **.txt** files and place the new files in the required group of servers.
we have different groups of servers for deployment so we needed to modify the scripts and change the group name in **hosts** at the time of script run.
hosts file will be avilable in **/etc/ansible/hosts**
